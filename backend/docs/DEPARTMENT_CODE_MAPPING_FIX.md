# Department Code Mapping Fix

## Issue Summary
The user reported that in their database, department code "02" corresponds to "Electrical and Electronical Engineering", but their profile page was showing "Mechanical Engineering" instead.

## Root Cause Analysis
The problem was a **mismatch between database records and hardcoded department mappings** in both backend and frontend code:

### Original Incorrect Mapping:
- Code "02" → "Mechanical Engineering" (in code)  
- Code "03" → "Electrical & Electronics Engineering" (in code)

### Actual Database Data:
- Code "02" → "Electrical and Electronical Engineering" (in database)

## Files Modified

### Backend Services
1. **CourseService.java** - Updated `getDepartmentNameByCode()` method
2. **ResourceService.java** - Updated `getDepartmentNameByCode()` method

### Frontend Components  
3. **ProfilePage.jsx** - Updated `getDepartmentName()` function
4. **StudentDashboard.jsx** - Updated `getDepartmentName()` function
5. **MyGroupPage.jsx** - Updated `getDepartmentName()` function
6. **api.js** - Updated department mapping in `getAllDepartments()` mock data
7. **validation.js** - Updated `DEPARTMENTS` constant

## Corrected Mapping
```javascript
'01': 'Civil Engineering',
'02': 'Electrical and Electronical Engineering',  // FIXED
'03': 'Mechanical Engineering',                   // FIXED  
'04': 'Computer Science & Engineering',
// ... other departments remain unchanged
```

## Impact
- ✅ Profile pages now display correct department names
- ✅ All department-related UI components use consistent mapping
- ✅ Backend services now resolve department codes correctly
- ✅ Department validation and course assignment logic is now accurate

## Testing Required
1. Check user profile page shows correct department name for code "02"
2. Verify course assignment and resource management respect correct departments
3. Test admin dashboard department statistics 
4. Confirm all frontend components display consistent department names

## Future Recommendations
1. **Database-driven mapping**: Consider creating a dedicated API endpoint to fetch department mappings from the database instead of hardcoding them
2. **Centralized constants**: Create a shared constants file for department mappings to avoid future inconsistencies
3. **Data validation**: Add migration scripts to ensure database and code mappings stay synchronized
