# Department Management Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of dynamic department management in the CUET Sphere admin dashboard.

## Features Implemented

### Backend
1. **DepartmentService** - Service layer for department operations
   - Get all departments with codes and IDs
   - Create new departments 
   - Update existing departments
   - Delete departments (with validation)
   - Department code to name mapping

2. **DepartmentController** - REST API endpoints
   - `GET /api/admin/departments` - Get all departments
   - `POST /api/admin/departments` - Create department
   - `PUT /api/admin/departments/{id}` - Update department
   - `DELETE /api/admin/departments/{id}` - Delete department

3. **DTOs**
   - `DepartmentRequest` - For create/update operations
   - `DepartmentResponse` - Response with success/error info

### Frontend
1. **Updated DepartmentManager Component**
   - Load departments from backend API
   - Add new departments with validation
   - Edit existing departments inline
   - Delete departments with confirmation
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Auto-refresh after operations

2. **Enhanced ApiService**
   - Department CRUD operations
   - Mock data support for development
   - Error handling and response processing

3. **DepartmentService**
   - Utility service for department operations
   - Fallback to static data if API fails
   - Department name/code conversion utilities

## API Endpoints

### Get All Departments
```http
GET /api/admin/departments
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "departments": {
    "01": "Civil Engineering",
    "04": "Computer Science & Engineering",
    ...
  },
  "departmentIds": {
    "01": 1,
    "04": 4,
    ...
  },
  "total": 12
}
```

### Get Department Count
```http
GET /api/admin/departments/count
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 12
}
```

### Create Department
```http
POST /api/admin/departments
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "code": "18",
  "name": "New Department"
}
```

### Update Department
```http
PUT /api/admin/departments/{id}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "code": "18",
  "name": "Updated Department Name"
}
```

### Delete Department
```http
DELETE /api/admin/departments/{id}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

## Security
- All endpoints require system admin authentication
- Validates user permissions before operations
- Department deletion prevents deletion of departments with existing courses

## Validation
- Department codes must be unique
- Department names must be unique
- Cannot delete departments with associated courses
- Validates department code format and naming conventions

## Error Handling
- Frontend displays error messages with auto-dismiss
- Backend returns proper HTTP status codes
- Graceful fallback to static data if API unavailable
- Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous operations

## Usage
1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
2. Access Department Manager section
3. View existing departments with codes
4. Add new departments using the form
5. Edit departments inline by clicking edit button
6. Delete departments with confirmation dialog

## Migration Notes
- Existing DEPARTMENTS constant in validation.js still works as fallback
- Department codes maintain CUET standard format (01-17+)
- Database IDs are tracked separately from display codes
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing components
