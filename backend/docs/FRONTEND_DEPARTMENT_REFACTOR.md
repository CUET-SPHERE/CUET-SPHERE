# Frontend Department Mapping Refactor

## Overview
Removed hardcoded department mappings from frontend components and replaced with backend API integration to fetch department names dynamically.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes
1. **Fixed DepartmentService.java** - Updated hardcoded mapping to match database
2. **Created PublicDepartmentController.java** - New public API endpoints:
   - `GET /api/public/departments/code/{code}` - Get department name by code
   - `GET /api/public/departments/all` - Get all department codes and names

### Frontend Changes

#### New Utility Module
- **`departmentUtils.js`** - Centralized department management with caching:
  - `getDepartmentName(code)` - Async function to get department name from API
  - `getDepartmentNameSync(code)` - Sync function using cached data
  - `preloadDepartments()` - Preload all departments into cache
  - `clearDepartmentCache()` - Clear cache for testing

#### Updated Components
1. **App.jsx** - Added department preloading on app initialization
2. **ProfilePage.jsx** - Removed hardcoded mapping, uses backend API with state management
3. **MyGroupPage.jsx** - Removed hardcoded mapping, uses cached sync lookup
4. **StudentDashboard.jsx** - Removed hardcoded mapping, uses cached sync lookup
5. **api.js** - Updated getAllDepartments() to use public endpoint
6. **validation.js** - Replaced static DEPARTMENTS with dynamic function

## API Endpoints

### Public Department Endpoints (No Authentication Required)

#### Get Department Name by Code
```
GET /api/public/departments/code/{code}

Response:
{
  "code": "02",
  "name": "Electrical and Electronical Engineering",
  "success": true
}
```

#### Get All Departments
```
GET /api/public/departments/all

Response:
{
  "departments": {
    "01": "Civil Engineering",
    "02": "Electrical and Electronical Engineering",
    ...
  },
  "departmentIds": {
    "01": 1,
    "02": 2,
    ...
  },
  "total": 12,
  "success": true
}
```

## Implementation Pattern

### For Components with State Management (e.g., ProfilePage)
```jsx
const [departmentName, setDepartmentName] = useState('Loading...');

useEffect(() => {
  const loadDepartmentName = async () => {
    if (user?.department) {
      const name = await getDepartmentName(user.department);
      setDepartmentName(name);
    }
  };
  loadDepartmentName();
}, [user?.department]);
```

### For Simple Display Components (e.g., MyGroupPage, StudentDashboard)
```jsx
import { getDepartmentNameSync, preloadDepartments } from '../utils/departmentUtils';

// Initialize cache on mount
useEffect(() => {
  preloadDepartments();
}, []);

// Use sync function in render
{getDepartmentNameSync(user?.department)}
```

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth** - Department names come from database via backend API
2. **No Code Duplication** - Eliminated hardcoded mappings across multiple files
3. **Consistency** - All components use the same department data
4. **Maintainability** - Department changes only need to be made in database
5. **Performance** - Caching prevents repeated API calls
6. **Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks for failed API calls

## Error Handling

- API failures fall back to "Unknown Department"
- Cache misses return "Unknown Department"
- Loading states for async operations
- Console warnings for debugging

## Migration Notes

- ✅ Removed hardcoded department mappings from all frontend components
- ✅ Created centralized department utility with caching
- ✅ Added public API endpoints for department data
- ✅ Updated all components to use new pattern
- ✅ Added preloading for performance optimization

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding department data to user context for even better performance
2. Add department validation in forms using backend data
3. Implement real-time updates if departments change
4. Add loading skeletons for better UX
